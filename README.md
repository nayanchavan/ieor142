## F21 IEOR 142 Final Project
Group Members: Priya Kamdar, Nirmol Kaur, Harry Li, Ananya Raghavan, and Nayan Chavan 

üè† Our project is based on helping people through the process of booking Airbnbs and helping them save money. Throughout the semester we focused on being able to predict the price of an Airbnb given particular features in different neighborhoods. Our goal was to help people figure out the predicted price for the Airbnb listing given the features of the surrounding area and how it compares to the actual price of the Airbnb rental unit they are looking at.
